    The main hobby for recent few months is <strong>programming</strong>. Before I started programming course, I didn't
    know anything about computer programming. Now I know some things about it: i.e., I have common issues about
    backend. I can programme not difficult things on Python, know basic things about Django and databases.
    Of course, the course itself is not enough for getting job in programming sphere, so I am trying to get
    more information from the internet and books.

    <br>
    Furthermore, I finally started learning <strong>English</strong>. I had not bad base for it thanks to my English
    teacher at school: generally, I could understand English texts and speech. English improvement also will be helpful
    for learning programming.
